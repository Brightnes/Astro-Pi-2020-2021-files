# Astro-Pi-2020-2021-files
Data files used for magnetic field and other stuff study.

data01.csv are raw data got from current 2020-20221 Astro Pi ed.

jesto_data01.csv are raw data got from 2019-2020 Astro Pi former ed.

jesto_data01_edited.numbers are data from 2019-2020 ed; extra values are computed from raw data. A shareable xlsx copy of the file may differ somewhat from original version.

dati_misurati_acc_mag_totali.numbers are data from 2020-2021 ed; extra values are computed from raw data. A shareable xlsx copy of the file may differ somewhat from original version.

traject_20_vs_21.numbers file compares mean magnetic field intensity at same ISS overflight passes; magnetic field mean values are averages computed from sets of 5 measures at passes very close to the trajectory intersection coordinates. A shareable copy of the file may differ somewhat from original version.

I added three images: the raw NoIR (blue filtered) photo of the pass above Gough island; the same photo edited for NDVI indexing; and a detail of Gough island compared to Google Maps satellite image showing bogs.
